# Fall Updates 2022
*Date: December 2022*

## Classes

During Autumn 2022, I enrolled in Applied Linear Algebra (with Python), Computer Programming 2 (with Java), and Physics 2 Electricity and Magnetism. Simultaneously, I made the decision to transition my major from Electrical and Computer Engineering to Computer Engineering.

## Projects

This quarter, I had the opportunity to engage in Husky Coding Project, a university club that facilitates collaborative team-based web development projects spanning an entire academic year. My team's project involved creating a website that provides typing practice, with a focus on programming syntax, under the name "Syntext." I have devoted a substantial portion of my time outside of class to work on this project over the course of the year.

In addition, I found Applied Linear Algebra to be the most rewarding class I have taken thus far. Through this course, I acquired foundational knowledge in machine learning, including k-means clustering, singular value decomposition, model fitting and interpolation, as well as data fitting and model creation through the use of least squares. This course also featured practical projects, such as image compression, video background removal, voting prediction models, and principle component analysis for analyzing high-dimensional relations between datasets.

## Goals

Throughout this quarter, I have focused on developing skills that will enhance my future career prospects. While maintaining my GPA remains a priority, I have devoted a portion of my time each week to learning React and reinforcing my Javascript proficiency.

In Autumn Quarter, I joined the UW Sensors Energy and Automation Lab as a web developer and have since gained valuable experience. Due to the departure of our project manager, I assumed a leadership role in our team. Although this proved to be a challenging experience, we successfully resolved several major bugs and redeployed the site with a working backend. Through this process, I acquired knowledge on topics such as CORS and AWS deployment. My tenure with SEAL UW will conclude at the end of the year; however, I am grateful for the opportunity to have contributed and learned so much about software development and leadership.
