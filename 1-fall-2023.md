## Fall Updates 2023

**December 2023**

### Some Personal Updates

I recently participated in DubHacks 2023, where my team and I created a web page that recommends groupings of people based on their responses to a Google Form. We used the Google Forms API to retrieve the responses to any existing form and allowed the user to rank the importance of each question. We then used a pretty crazy algorithm to find the optimal groupings of people based on their responses to the form.

To summarize it briefly, we created clusters of people, one for each question (using K-means). We then created a Matrix of the distances between each person in each cluster and then used a greedy algorithm to find the most balanced groupings of people by sorting each row of people.

First, we picked k individuals with the worst average rankings for each question relative to the other respondents as representatives for each group. Then, we continued to assign the remaining respondents to their best group representative. We referred to this as "balanced groupings" since it ensured that each person would be assigned to a group that they were at least semi-compatible with.

Next, we selected the k "most popular" individuals as representatives, which were the people who had the highest average rankings for each question, assigning the remaining n - k people to their most compatible group representative. We referred to this as "selfish groupings", since it would lead to the less "popular" people being assigned to groups that they were barely compatible with. This was hardly an optimal algorithm, and almost certainly wasn't the best possible way to group people, but it did prove to be an interesting and effective heuristic.

As an officer of a few clubs, I've been pretty busy this quarter. As a club lead in HCP, I've been working on a few projects, including our [new website](https://hcp-uw.vercel.app/), and a couple project starter templates for members to use. Check out the docs and starter app I created for [fastapi and react](https://github.com/hcp-uw/react-fastapi-starter-template/tree/main)!

I'm also about to kick off a new technical mock interview program for SWECC in the next few weeks, which I'm super excited about. Over 50 people have already signed up, so I definitely have my work cut out for me.

### Some School Updates

As we speak, I'm writing this update instead of studying for my CSE 312 midterm.

This quarter, I'm taking CSE 312 (Foundations of Computing II) and CSE 333 (Systems Programming). I'm really enjoying both classes so far, but especially CSE 333. I've always been interested in low-level programming, and this class has been a great way to solidify my understanding of C++.

So far in 333, we've implemented the C file I/O library using POSIX system calls, created a file indexer and search engine, and are currently working on implementing the IO portion of a simple HTTP server in C++.

I _guess_ I'm also enjoying CSE 312 (a probability and statistics class), but only because a few of our assignments involve coding in python. It is a pretty unfortunate situation when you are able to brute force a counting problem in python, but struggle to solve it using combinatorics. Still definitely a great class though. We've gotten to create a spam detector using Naive Bayes classification and are currently working implementing a bloom filter for large dataset membership queries.
