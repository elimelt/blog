# Winter Updates 2023
*Date: February 2023*

## Classes

During Winter 2023, I was able to successfully petition into an exclusive discrete math/logic class for CS majors. Along with that, I enrolled in a database management systems course, where I learned about MS SQL Server and Azure Cloud. These classes have been extremely rewarding, and I have become very proficient in SQL. I've already been able to apply much of what I've learned in SQL Server to my work with Syntext, which utilizes MySQL. While both SQL Server and MySQL have their strengths, I personally prefer working with MySQL.

## Projects

In my free time, I'm dedicated to working on Syntext, but I've also been exploring various areas of frontend development through weekend side projects. Although Syntext's development primarily focuses on the backend, as our team is mostly comprised of frontend developers, I've been responsible for overseeing and architecting much of our frontend development. To improve my skills, I have been practicing designing UI codebases from a high level and implementing various front ends on my own.

Despite the seemingly generic nature of the projects assigned in my DBSM class, I've gained valuable experience through writing queries for large datasets and working on a Java CLI program. This program manages users stored in an Azure database using JDBC, and through its development, I've learned interesting design patterns such as Builder and Model View Controller (though the View was a simple CLI program).

## Goals

I am pleased to announce that I have successfully secured an internship for this upcoming summer with [StockCharts](StockCharts.com) as a backend Java developer, which was one of my top goals.

In addition to this, I have been striving to enhance my skills using Docker, and have started utilizing it as a full-stack development environment for Syntext. Despite facing configuration challenges with Docker Compose, I have managed to establish a strong understanding of how our services communicate and interact, and have improved my debugging skills through the resolution of numerous errors.

Another one of my objectives has been to implement test-driven development as frequently as possible. As the complexity of the projects I am working on continues to increase, it has become increasingly important for me to test my code, saving me time by composing tests upfront. Prior to embarking on a significant project, I like to create a specification that outlines all of the functions, classes, and endpoints that I will write, outlining all inputs, outputs, schemas, and other relevant details. Recently, I learned a few testing frameworks (JUnit for Java, Jest for JavaScript), and with their verbosity, writing tests has become simpler and quicker. I am eager to become a more methodical and disciplined software engineer, and believe that these efforts will improve my productivity.
